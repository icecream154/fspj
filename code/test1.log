All mimsy were the borogoves,
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
  And burbled as it came!
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
  And stood awhile in thought.
  And the mome raths outgrabe.
  And the mome raths outgrabe.
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
disk mounted.
  He chortled in his joy.
He left it dead, and with its head
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
  He went galumphing back.
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
One, two! One, two! And through and through
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
